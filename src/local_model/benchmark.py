# TODO: Define experiments

# Data based experiments
# 1. Use data for just a single state
# 2. Use data for all states (whole dataset)
# 3. Use data with categories (divide states to categories by GDP in the last year, by geolocation, ...)

# Model input based eperiments:
# 1. Compare performance of LSTM networks with different neurons in layers, try to find optimal
# 2. Compare prediction using whole state data and the last few records of data
# 3. Predict parameters for different years (e.g. to 2030, 2040, ... )
# 4. Compare model with statistical methods (ARIMA, GM)

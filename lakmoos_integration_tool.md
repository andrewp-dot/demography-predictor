# Lakmoos tool 

Here you will find the description of the tool which is used for generating the future population demography.

## The input

There are 2 types of input available:

1. Population data (sequnece of features of previous development for population)
2. Just the state name (I already have some sequences of population data)

## The output

The output should be compatible with Lakmoos **AI-backend-pro-max** system. There are several generators in this system which uses the demography data as an input.

The output should by in a form of some skewed-normal distribution curve.

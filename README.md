# Welcome to the Demography-Predictor project!

This project is aimed to create an universal model for predicting future development of the states demography. Available parameters for predictions are aging groups (
    `population ages 0-14`, `population ages 15-64`, `population ages 65 and above`) and gender distribution (`population male`, `population female`). The full predictor is made by chained 2 models:

1. Model of feature future development prediction 
2. Model of target variables prediction 

You can create your own model by editing scripts in the `src` folder, or just use predefined CLI.

## Installation
